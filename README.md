# Secure and Private AI Scholarship by Udacity (PySyft)

Extend PyTorch with the tools necessary to train AI models that preserve user privacy

## Section 3: Securing Federated Learning

Secure modeks trained using federated learning with multi-party computation in the `Section 3: Securing Federated Learning` notebook.
* Lesson 1: Trusted Aggregator
* Lesson 2: Intro to Additive Secret Sharing
* Lesson 3: Intro to Fixed Precision Encoding
* Lesson 4: Secret Sharing + Fixed Precision in PySyft
* Final Project: Federated Learning wtih Encrypted Gradient Aggregation

## Section 4: Encrypted Deep Learning

Learn how to predict on encrypted data while the model that you're using for prediction is also encrypted. Take all the parameters of our model and in our dataset, encrypt them and build a run prediction while it's in an encrypted state in the `Section 4 - Encrypted Deep Learning.ipynb` notebook
